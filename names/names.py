# This runs in 7.124 seconds on my computer. It's runtime complexity is therefore O(n^2) --> its polynomial, so when the input size increases, the runtime or space used will grow at a faster rate. Not a great solution as it's not scalable.

# ---------- Stretch Goal -----------
# Python has built-in tools that allow for a very efficient approach to this problem
# What's the best time you can accomplish?  Thare are no restrictions on techniques or data
# structures, but you may not import any additional libraries that you did not write yourself.
